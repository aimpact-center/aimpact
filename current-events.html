									title: "Airplanes for the mind",
									description: "Steve Jobs famously called computers “bicycles for the mind”—a metaphor for the personal-computing era, emphasizing tools that let individuals go farther and faster with less effort. Today, AI agents demand a new metaphor. They are airplanes for the mind: heavier-than-air machines that should not fly but do. These “airplanes” have the potential to dramatically extend the scale, speed, and coordination of human cognition, while introducing new challenges for science and discovery. This talk will focus on these “airplanes” and ask what changes for science when AI systems move from passive tools to active partners. Drawing on research from the science of science, I examine how advances in AI reshape discovery by surfacing overlooked ideas, reducing search and coordination costs, and revealing vast reservoirs of untapped innovative potential. I also show that scientific and technological progress is inherently punctuated, and discuss how these AI systems may alter incentives, attention, and pathways of collective scientific progress, raising new challenges for how science is conducted and evaluated. Throughout history, discoveries have been made by humans. As AI systems increasingly participate in discovery, the central question is not what machines can do alone, but how we design human–AI collaboration to make science more accountable, reproducible, and ultimately transformative. The question is not whether machines replace scientists, but what kind of scientist emerges when we learn to fly.<br><br>Dashun Wang is the Kellogg Chair of Technology and Professor at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. He is also affiliated with the McCormick School of Engineering and the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.

									title: "AI and the quantity and quality of creative products:  have LLMs boosted creation of valuable books?",
									description: "The arrival of LLMs has facilitated increased creation of new books.  As LLMs have diffused between 2022 and 2025, the number of new books appearing for sale each month at Amazon nearly tripled.  We develop a ratings-based usage measure that is comparable across book release vintages, and we find that the vintages from the AI influx period have lower average quality.  Yet, the top 1,000 monthly releases per category -- albeit not the top 100 -- have higher quality than before; and the effect is larger in categories with faster growth in new titles.   A nested logit calibration shows that LLM-enhanced book production could, in steady state, double the surplus that consumers derived from book markets.  The advent of LLMs does not displace incumbent author activity; instead, it raises their productivity. ",

									title: "Designing Human-AI Collaboration: A Sufficient Statistic Approach",
									description: "We develop a sufficient-statistic approach to designing collaborative human-AI decision-making policies in classification problems, where AI predictions can be used to either automate decisions or selectively assist humans. The approach allows for endogenous and biased beliefs, and effort crowd-out, without imposing a structural model of human decision-making. We deploy and validate our approach in an online fact-checking experiment. We find that humans under-respond to AI predictions and reduce effort when presented with confident AI predictions. AI under-response stems more from human overconfidence in own-signal precision than from under-confidence in AI. The optimal policy automates cases where the AI is confident and delegates uncertain cases to humans while fully disclosing the AI prediction. Although automation is valuable, the additional benefit from assisting humans with AI predictions is negligible.<br><br>Alex is an assistant professor at the Daniels School of Business at Purdue University. His research focuses on the economics of digitization with an emphasis on digital platforms, Human-AI interaction, and social influence.<br><br>Alex holds a PhD from the MIT Sloan School of Management in addition to a BS in Business Administration and BA in Economics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He has also worked as a research assistant at Microsoft Research and an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.",

									title: "Measuring the Consumer Benefits of AI",
									description: "AI is transforming daily life far faster than conventional economic statistics suggest. While productivity and GDP figures show only modest gains, measuring consumer welfare reveals that Americans already derived about $97 billion in annual value from generative AI tools in 2024—more than ten times the industry’s recorded revenues. This talk introduces GDP-B (B for benefits), a complementary metric to GDP that captures the value of free and digital goods such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. Drawing on large-scale incentive-compatible choice experiments across countries, the presentation shows how digital technologies and AI generate huge but largely invisible welfare gains that also reduce inequality. By augmenting production-based metrics with welfare metrics, we can gain a deeper understanding of how technological innovation truly enhances people’s lives.",

The impacts of monoculture can vary significantly across domains, with wide-ranging implications for efficiency, competition, human-AI collaboration, and culture. In this talk, we'll explore the value of information heterogeneity from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.",

									title: "Opportunities and Challenges in Human-AI Collaboration",
									description: "In this talk, I will describe prior work and current research in human-AI collaboration, specifically focusing on the role theoretical modeling can play in better understanding when socially desirable outcomes are feasible. In particular, I will discuss the influence that different factors can have, such as human cognitive biases, the way that the human and AI interact, and different levels of accuracy. First, I will discuss the goal of strict benefits to human-algorithm collaboration (complementarity, Bansal et al '21), presenting several impossibility results and conditions for when complementarity may be in tension with other goals, such as fairness. These results help us understand when we can (and cannot) achieve certain accuracy goals, and give insight into how we should design AI tools. Next, I will present a stylized model of a strategic-decision using an algorithmic tool: a firm using an algorithmic tool to select candidates. We show that when the firm has access to side information (e.g. employment status of candidates), counter-intuitive results can occur, such as increased accuracy of the AI tool leading to worse social outcomes. Finally, I will conclude by discussing several directions in human-LLM interaction and the ways in which generative AI poses unique challenges (and benefits).",

									title: "Regulation of Algorithmic Collusion",
									description: "Consider sellers in a competitive market that use algorithms to adapt their prices from data that they collect. In such a context it is plausible that algorithms could arrive at prices that are higher than the competitive prices and this may benefit sellers at the expense of consumers (i.e., the buyers in the market). I will present a definition of plausible algorithmic non-collusion for pricing algorithms. The definition allows a regulator to empirically audit algorithms by applying a statistical test to the data that they collect. Algorithms that are good, i.e., approximately optimize prices to market conditions, can be augmented to collect the data sufficient to pass the audit. Algorithms that have colluded on, e.g., supra-competitive prices cannot pass the audit. The definition allows sellers to possess useful side information that may be correlated with supply and demand and could affect the prices used by good algorithms. I will present an analysis of the statistical complexity of such an audit, i.e., how much data is sufficient for the test of non-collusion to be accurate.",
